            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  <h2>1. Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h2>
                  <p>
                    SpaceX's Dragon could reach lunar orbit but lacks the capacity to land on the Moon. The Dragon 2 capsule carries limited propellant and lacks the necessary delta-v (âˆ†V) to decelerate from orbital velocity for a lunar landing. While Falcon Heavy can transport the Dragon 2 to lunar orbit, additional technology development or multiple launches may be necessary for a landing attempt.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>2. What is Red Dragon?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Red Dragon was a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission aiming to land a modified Dragon capsule on Mars using a Falcon Heavy rocket. The unmanned mission was designed as a scientific lander capable of carrying 2 metric tons of cargo. However, this project has not received official confirmation or funding from SpaceX.
                  </p>
                
                <h2>3. Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</h2>
                  <p>
                    No, the Dragon is deemed inadequate for a manned Mars mission due to space limitations and the need for significant improvements in its life support system. Elon Musk stated that the Dragon 2 can sustain seven astronauts for "several days" but isn't suited for long-duration journeys to Mars.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>4. Why does the Dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</h2>
                  <p>
                    The current Dragon version uses a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) port, necessitating manual maneuvering by astronauts and physical bolting for attachment. This process, known as berthing, contrasts with autonomous docking, which is faster and more efficient but requires a different docking system not present on the Dragon.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>5. Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station (ISS)?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Dragon 1's berthing process is slow and unsuitable for quick emergency evacuations. With two Soyuz capsules permanently attached to the ISS and capable of rapid evacuation, scenarios requiring Dragon as an escape pod seem unlikely.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>6. Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</h2>
                  <p>
                    No, Dragon lacks the necessary fuel, docking port capabilities, and connections to facilitate station reboost. The current methods for reboosting the ISS are sufficient and do not require modifications like those needed for Dragon.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>7. How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</h2>
                  <p>
                    The Dragon 2 possesses a delta-v of approximately 420 meters per second (m/s) with a total weight of 21,000 lbs (9,525 kg), including 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg) of propellant for its SuperDraco engines.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>8. What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters were to fail during landing?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Dragon 2 can operate safely even if two out of its eight SuperDraco thrusters fail. In case of thruster failure, parachutes will deploy, leading the craft to splash down in the Atlantic Ocean.
                  </p>
                  <h2>9. Will SuperDraco replace Draco?</h2>
                  <p>
                    SuperDraco and Draco engines serve different purposes due to their significant differences in thrust. SuperDraco's high thrust makes it unsuitable for the delicate maneuvers and adjustments performed by Draco engines in orbit.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>10. What is PICA-X? Does PICA-X ablate?</h2>
                  <p>
                    PICA-X, an improved version of the Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) heatshield, is designed for spacecraft reentry. It ablates less significantly than previous versions, offering enhanced reusability for missions.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>11. Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</h2>
                  <p>
                    While technically feasible, servicing the Hubble Telescope with Dragon 2 would be economically impractical due to the absence of necessary equipment and the high cost compared to building and launching a new telescope.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>12. Why does Dragon's trunk stay attached during an abort scenario?</h2>
                  <p>
                    The trunk remains attached during an abort to stabilize the Dragon capsule and prevent immediate flipping, as the aerodynamic trunk aids in maintaining proper orientation.
                  </p>
                
                  <h2>13. How does a Dragon reenter the atmosphere and splashdown?</h2>
                  <p>
                    The Dragon initiates a deorbit burn, jettisons its trunk, aligns for reentry, deploys parachutes, and lands in the ocean, using a multi-step process to ensure a safe descent and splashdown.
                  </p>
