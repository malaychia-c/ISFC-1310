    <h2> My thoughts on Accessibility </h2>
    <p> Web accessibility is about making websites usable for everyone, including those with disabilities.It also  shows that your company cares about inclusivity and being ethical, which can improve your reputation and lead to partnerships with others who share these values. In a nutshell, web accessibility is a smart move for both your website and your business.</p>
