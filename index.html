    <h2> My thoughts on Accessibility </h2>
    <p> Web accessibility is about making websites usable for everyone, including those with disabilities.It also  shows that your company cares about inclusivity and being ethical, which can improve your reputation and lead to partnerships with others who share these values. In a nutshell, web accessibility is a smart move for both your website and your business.</p>
    <h2> Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p> I see Progressive Enhancement as crucial in modern web development because it's all about inclusivity and reliability. It ensures that everyone, no matter their device or browser, can access and use a website effectively. By focusing on this approach, websites become more robust, adaptable, and better equipped to handle new technologies, like a strong foundation supporting a building through different weather conditions.</p>
    <h2> Dragon X Reflection</h2>
    <p> When my family reviewed my Dragon X project, they appreciated the effort I put into linking the pages, which was encouraging. However, they also identified several areas needing improvement, especially in terms of usability.

      The biggest feedback they provided was about its usability they found it challenging to navigate and interact smoothly. Taking their advice seriously, I invested in time and research exploring ways to enhance the user-friendliness. Delving  into different approaches to streamline navigation and make accessing information more effortless.</p>
    <p>I recognize that better time management could have significantly improved the project's overall quality. While I managed to establish page connections adequately, a more structured approach and planning might have made the project smoother and easier to navigate right from the start.

      This project made me faced a few challenges throughout this class. My confidence and staying on track. Doubts about my abilities led to falling behind on tasks, making it hard to catch up and maintain confidence in my work. </p>
    <p> This experience taught me a crucial lesson - prioritizing user experience is paramount. Recognizing the significance of making projects user-friendly for everyone became evident while revising the project. The updated version integrates numerous enhancements, featuring clearer navigation buttons and improved usability.

       I understand now the importance of taking feedback seriously and learning from both technical and personal challenges. Addressing usability issues is what really curved my learning point. I'm exicted to continue learning and growing, ready to enhance my skills and create projects that offer an enjoyable experience for users</p>
